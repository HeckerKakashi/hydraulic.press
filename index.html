            <h1>What is Pascal’s Law?</h1>
            <h3>Pascal’s Law states that when pressure is applied to a confined fluid, that pressure is transmitted equally in all directions throughout the fluid. Think of it like squeezing a balloon: if you press on one part of the balloon, the entire balloon feels the pressure, not just the spot you squeezed.</h3>

            <h2>The Hydraulic Press: The Heavy Lifter</h2>
            <h3>A hydraulic press is a machine that uses Pascal’s Law to amplify force. It can turn a small input force into a much larger output force, making it super useful in things like car brakes, garbage compactors, or even manufacturing metal parts.</h3>

            <h2>1. Two Pistons (Small and Large): Picture two pistons (imagine they are plungers) connected by a tube filled with oil. One piston is small, and one piston is large. <br><br><br>

2. The small piston is like the button you press. The large piston is where the magic happens —  it’s where the heavy object gets lifted. Pascal’s Law in Action: When you push down on the small  piston, the pressure is transmitted through the fluid (oil), equally, to the large piston. <br><br><br>

3. Force Multiplication: Here’s the cool part: the force you apply on the small piston gets multiplied     by the size difference between the pistons. If the large piston has 10 times the area of the small piston, the force on the large piston will be 10 times greater than the force you applied. That’s how you can lift really heavy objects with just a little effort!</h2>
